### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**RoyZhaoGA/RoyZhaoGA** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Previous coding experience, if any. 
During the summer of 2021, I look a course on basic Java programming and learned how to code variables, Data types (Array and Arraylists), Functions, Classes, Objects, Loops, Conditions. After that, I learned to use MIT app inventor and worked on several projects on my own, including a route finder and a weather reporting system.

I think this class will give me a great opportunity to improve my knowledge of CS by working on more projects

I am interested in earth science, more specifically meteorology and geology.

I have recently started to learn to code in python, and I would like to work on a project that uses web scraping. I would also like to familiarize myself with HTML and Javascript this year.
